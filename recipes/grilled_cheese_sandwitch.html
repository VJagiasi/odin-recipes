    <h1>How to make the Best Grilled Cheese Sandwitch</h1>
    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>white bread</li>
        <li>sliced cheese</li>
        <li>butter</li>
    </ul>
    <p> It's easy to switch up the bread and cheese to suit your taste preferences and, if you like, you can substitute mayonnaise for butter.</p>
    <h2>Best Cheese for Grilled Cheese</h2>
    <p>This recipe calls for sliced Cheddar, which is a wonderfully crowd-pleasing cheese. You can use sharp Cheddar, mild Cheddar, or a blend of both. Another classic choice is plain ol' sliced American cheese â€“ it tastes nostalgic and gives you a gorgeous cheese pull.</p>
    <p>Other delicious options are Gruyere, Brie, Fontina, Gouda, Pepper Jack, and havarti.</p>
